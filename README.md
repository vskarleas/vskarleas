# 👋 Hi, I'm Vasilis Skarleas!

I'm a robotics engineering student at Polytech Sorbonne with a passion for space and medical robotics applications. When I'm not building robots or diving into ROS projects, you'll find me exploring entrepreneurship and producing media content that inspires others in STEM.

## 🤖 Robotics & Engineering

- Currently working on robotics projects using **ROS (Robot Operating System)**, focusing on robot control systems and computer vision with OpenCV
- Passionate about developing robotics solutions for space exploration and medical applications
- Hands-on experience with 3D printing and prototyping for robotics components
- Building skills in robot kinematics, sensor integration, and autonomous systems

## 💡 Tech Projects & Entrepreneurship 

- **Former CTO & Co-Founder** of [Lekitable](https://www.lekitable.fr) - France's pioneering green-products network 🌱
- Created [Patients DB 2.0](https://madebyvasilis.site/apps) - A HIPAA-compliant medical records system
- Developed [VScloud Connect](https://cloud.madebyvasilis.site) - A comprehensive client and project management solution
