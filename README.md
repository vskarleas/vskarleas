# üëã Hi, I'm Vasilis Skarleas!

I'm a robotics engineering student at Polytech Sorbonne with a passion for space, automobile and medical robotics applications. I have contributed to several research programs and open source projects like the ROS2 impementation via Robostack, the manipulation of cobots in a constraint-manner, machine learning on images processing etc. Check out mmy CV and bia at [vskarleas.com](https://vskarleas.com/)
